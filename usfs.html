		<p>The <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/">U.S. Forest Service</a> issues &#8220;special use&#8221; permits to ensure the safe and responsible use of public lands. But, permit seekers often find themselves frustrated. Rules aren&#8217;t the same between forests, the process is often arduous, and people get rejections for unknown reasons. This leads to people giving up on the process, which can have disastrous consequences for safety and the natural environment.</p>

				<figcaption class="prefix-5">One of the first design activities I did was taking a look at Standard Form 299 (SF-299) and deconstructing it a bit. This was a form we had heard all about during our research, and was really the core of the proposal and application process. Nothing on the form is particularly clear and it asks you to write a ton of open-ended prose. It was no surprise that a ton of permit seekers were getting it “wrong” so often. I went through it section by section and figured out how we might split it up into more manageable chunks.</figcaption>

				<blockquote class="big-quote">There’s generally one form: a temporary use or something like that, but there’s also the 299 – that’s for all sorts of uses. Some of the forests have us use that as our initial application, but not all. So that’s not necessarily consistent.</blockquote>

		<h2 id="weshippedasmallonlinepermittingprototype.">We shipped a small, online permitting prototype.</h2>
		
		<p>My team built proof of concept with a deliberately tight scope. We demonstrated an improved experience for applying for a permit while still complying with Forest Service&#8217;s required intake regulations.</p>
		
		<p><strong>With our prototype in hand, our partners were able to get more funding, hire a full-time product owner, and move on to the next phase of work.</strong></p>

				<figcaption class="prefix-5">As we iterated, I moved into higher fidelity designs that matched Forest Service's existing design language. But eventually we got to a point where we it made more sense to design and build directly in code. My colleague, Neil Martinsen-Burell set up a very basic “hello world” site on cloud.gov and we collaborated to bring the prototype to life.
